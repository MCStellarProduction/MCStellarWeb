        <h1 class="white_bold">UNAUTHORIZED</h1>
        <h3 class="white_desc">You are currently unable to access the client because you do not have the necessary authorization to use this page. This could be due to a number of reasons, including a lack of specific permissions, your account not being included in the list of authorized users, or an active restriction limiting your access. It is important to note that these security measures are designed to protect the integrity of the platform, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure that people who use it comply with established regulations. 

Possible causes of this restriction may include the omission of essential steps in the registration process, the lack of verification of your account, or the non-acceptance of terms and conditions required to use the system. It is also possible that, for some reason, anomalous activity has been detected from your account, which has led to a temporary preventive restriction being activated. In other cases, permissions to access certain resources may be limited to specific users, such as authorized personnel, moderators, or administrators. 

If you believe that you should have access or that this restriction is in error, we recommend that you act immediately by contacting a moderator or system administrator.  They are the right people to investigate your case, review the specific details of your account, and offer you a customized solution. When you contact the support team, it is essential that you provide all relevant information that can help them quickly identify and resolve the problem. This includes, but is not limited to, your username, the email associated with your account, the date and time you attempted to log in, a description of the problem you are experiencing, and any error messages that may have been displayed on the screen. 

In some cases, the support team may request additional information from you, such as screenshots or details about the network you attempted to log in from, in order to conduct a more thorough investigation. We ask that you be as clear and detailed as possible when explaining your situation, as this will make it easier for moderators to diagnose the problem and offer you an appropriate solution. 

It is important to note that access restrictions are not always final. In most cases, if you meet the necessary requirements, adjustments can be made to restore your access.  For example, if this is a new account, you may need to complete an identity verification or provide confirmation that you agree to the platform's usage policies. If you are trying to access from an unrecognized device, additional verification may be required to ensure that this is not an unauthorized access attempt. 

While you wait for a response from the support team, we suggest you review the FAQ and any official documentation related to access and use of the platform. You may find useful information that will help you better understand the situation or even resolve the issue on your own. 

The main purpose of these measures is not to limit access without justification, but to protect both users and the system from potential risks, ensure the security of information, and prevent misuse of available resources. If your access is legitimate and you comply with the established policies, you can be assured that the support team will do everything possible to help you regain access. 

We ask for your patience and understanding while this issue is resolved.  We know how important it is for you to access the client and we want to make sure everything works smoothly for you and other users. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact the support team or check out the official communication channels. We are committed to providing you with the best possible service and resolving any issues that may arise.</h3>
